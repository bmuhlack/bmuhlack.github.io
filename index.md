I am a research assistant and a PhD student in the Phonetics and Phonology group (head: Prof. Dr. Bernd Möbius) in the Language Science and Technology department at Saarland University in Saarbrücken, Germany.

I started working in the <a href = "http://pauseparticles.org/" target = "_blank">PINTS project</a> in May 2020. Together with two PIs (<a href = "https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~moebius/mywww/index.html" target = "_blank">Prof. Dr. Bernd Möbius</a> and <a href = "https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~trouvain/" target = "_blank">Dr. Jürgen Trouvain</a>) and two other PhD-students (<a href = "https://raphael-werner.github.io/" target = "_blank">Raphael Werner</a> and Mikey Elmers) I am looking at pause-internal phonetic particles in spoken language. My research project focuses on hesitation particles in German as well as other languages.
