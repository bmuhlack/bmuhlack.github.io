I am a research assistant and a PhD student in the Phonetics group in the Language Science and Technology department at Saarland University in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany.
I am working in the [PINTS project](https://www.pauseparticles.org) which is looking at pause-internal particles in spoken language. My research project focusses on hesitation particles in German as well as other languages.
