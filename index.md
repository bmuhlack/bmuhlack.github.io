Since October 2023, I am an instructor for Phonetics at the Goethe-University Frankfurt, Germany at the institute for Empirical Linguistics headed by <a href = "https://gerdcarling.se/" target = "_blank">Prof. Dr. Gerd Carling</a>. This semester I am teaching a class on Perception and another one on Statistics. Find out more about my teaching <a href = "https://bmuhlack.github.io/teaching/">here</a>.

I am also a PhD student in the Phonetics and Phonology group (head: Prof. Dr. Bernd Möbius) in the Language Science and Technology department at Saarland University in Saarbrücken, Germany.
I started working in the <a href = "http://pauseparticles.org/" target = "_blank">PINTS project</a> in May 2020. My research project focuses on filler particles in German as well as other languages and is supervised by <a href = "https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~moebius/mywww/index.html" target = "_blank">Prof. Dr. Bernd Möbius</a> and <a href = "https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~trouvain/" target = "_blank">Dr. Jürgen Trouvain</a>.
