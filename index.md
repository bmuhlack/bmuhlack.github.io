Welcome to my website!
I am a PhD student at Saarland University in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany. I am working in the [PINTS project](https://www.pauseparticles.org)
which is looking at pause-internal particles in spoken language. My research project focusses on hesitation particles in German as well as
other languages.
